Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, powerful code editor with support for extensions and debugging.

### Why VS Code is a Great IDE

VS Code is an indispensable tool for writing code used in satellites, ground stations, and managing space assets. Its customizability, support for multiple programming languages, and powerful debugging tools make it ideal for developing reliable and efficient software for critical space operations. Features like IntelliSense and integrated terminals streamline workflows, ensuring precision and productivity in space-related projects.

### Installation

1. Visit the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions.

### Basic Tutorial

1. Open VS Code and create a new file (`File > New File`).
2. Install extensions like Python or Markdown support from the Extensions Marketplace.
3. Use the integrated terminal (`Ctrl + ~`) to run commands.

### Using Git in VS Code

1. Open the Source Control view (`Ctrl + Shift + G`).
2. Stage changes by clicking the `+` icon next to modified files.
3. Commit changes with a message in the input box and press `Ctrl + Enter`. Committing saves a snapshot of your changes locally.
4. Push changes to a remote repository using the `...` menu or `Ctrl + Shift + P` > `Git: Push`. Pushing uploads your committed changes to a shared repository, making them accessible to collaborators.
5. Pull updates from the remote repository using `Git: Pull`. Pulling fetches the latest changes from the shared repository and integrates them into your local codebase.

Version control is essential for tracking changes, collaborating with teams, and ensuring code stability during deployment, especially in high-stakes environments like space systems.

### Using Copilot Responsibly

GitHub Copilot can assist in writing and modifying code by suggesting context-aware snippets. To enable Copilot in VS Code:
1. Install the GitHub Copilot extension from the Extensions Marketplace.
2. Sign in with your GitHub account and activate Copilot in the settings.

Always review and test AI-generated code to ensure it meets your requirements. A safe workflow is human (prompt) > AI (suggestion) > human (validation), avoiding direct copying to maintain quality and accountability.

VS Code is an essential tool for writing and debugging code for spacecraft systems.
