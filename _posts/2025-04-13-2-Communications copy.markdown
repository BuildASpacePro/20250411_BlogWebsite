In this post, I'm going to list all the sofrware tools needed to build a space program. This list isn't exhaustive, but should provide an engineer with enough to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

1. Visual Studio Code
2. ANSYS STK
3. NASA'S COSMOGRAPHIA
4. OpenC3
5. python Skyfield module
6. GNUradio
7. Solidworks
