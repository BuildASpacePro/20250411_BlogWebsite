The current landscape of launch vehicles represents one of the most dynamic periods in space access history. From commercial providers to national space agencies, the variety of rockets available today offers unprecedented options for reaching orbit.

## Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles

Heavy lift vehicles capable of delivering substantial payloads to orbit have become increasingly important for large satellite deployments, space station resupply, and deep space missions. Notable examples include:

- SpaceX Starship - Revolutionary fully reusable super heavy-lift vehicle
- NASA Space Launch System (SLS) - Government heavy-lift vehicle for deep space exploration
- Blue Origin New Glenn - Partially reusable heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle

## Medium Launch Vehicles

The medium-lift segment continues to serve as the workhorse for many satellite deployments and space missions, offering a balance between payload capacity and launch cost.

## Small Launch Vehicles

The rapidly growing small satellite market has spurred development of dedicated small launch vehicles, providing responsive and cost-effective access to space for CubeSats and other small payloads.
