Space tourism is no longer a distant dream but a rapidly emerging industry. Companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX are pioneering efforts to make space travel accessible to civilians.

Blue Origin, with its New Shepard suborbital vehicle, has already flown multiple passengers to the edge of space. Learn more about their groundbreaking work on [their official website](https://www.blueorigin.com).

As technology advances and costs decrease, space tourism is expected to grow exponentially, offering unique experiences such as zero-gravity flights, orbital stays, and even lunar tourism.
