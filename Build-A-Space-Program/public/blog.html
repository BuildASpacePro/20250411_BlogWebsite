                        The current landscape of launch vehicles represents one of the most dynamic periods 
                        in space access history. From commercial providers to national space agencies, 
                        the variety of rockets available today offers unprecedented options for reaching orbit.

                    <h3>Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Heavy lift vehicles capable of delivering substantial payloads to orbit have become 
                        increasingly important for large satellite deployments, space station resupply, and 
                        deep space missions. Notable examples include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SpaceX Starship - Revolutionary fully reusable super heavy-lift vehicle</li>
                        <li>NASA Space Launch System (SLS) - Government heavy-lift vehicle for deep space exploration</li>
                        <li>Blue Origin New Glenn - Partially reusable heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Medium Launch Vehicles</h3>
                    <p>
                        The medium-lift segment continues to serve as the workhorse for many satellite deployments 
                        and space missions, offering a balance between payload capacity and launch cost.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Small Launch Vehicles</h3>
                    <p>
                        The rapidly growing small satellite market has spurred development of dedicated 
                        small launch vehicles, providing responsive and cost-effective access to space 
                        for CubeSats and other small payloads.
                    </p>
